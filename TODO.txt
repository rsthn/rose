- Convert null/nil/true/false to keywords
- Make "if" just 3 parameters (if yes no) and omit the else
- Possibly replace (@ ...) with (do ...) like clojure does.
- Add "when" operator (when <cond> ...) which is a combination of if and do.
- Add conditionals that end with ? (null? eq? etc)
- POSSIBLY: Ensure strings are actually strings, not re-evaluated templates.
- POSSIBLY: Force arrays to be created with [] rather than (# ).
- POSSIBLY: Create maps using { } instead of (& ).
