Text

Remove all alpha() calls and replace with new().

Refactor: __nativeArray -> data ?
Refactor: PrimitiveType -> native

Ensure all uses of typeOf() correctly compare with Rose\ClassName
Remove the call_user_func.

Add recursive chmod to Path.
Ensure all try/catch using "Exception" actually use \Exception
Remove references to dummy functions located on Main

Completely re-build Text.format to new mechanism.
Ensure all string stuff uses Text class.

Test if Configuration loads 'env' and the appropriate related file.

!!!!!!!! Think if XML strings are still a good idea or if we should keep only .plain and .conf

Remove unnecessary getInstance() on classes that will never be used with Text.format
